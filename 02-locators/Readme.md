## How to Run the test on the LambdaTest?
You can learn the tests on the LambdaTest and analyze the tests from the LambaTest dashboard. To do that,

- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project.
- Add these environment variables in the `.env` file
   ```bash
   LT_USERNAME=<LAMBDATEST_USER_NAME>
   LT_ACCESS_KEY=<LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY>
   ```
- Open a terminal.
- Browse to the project folder
- Run the lambdatest script using this command:
  ```bash
  node playwright-lambdatest.js
  ```
- Now, got to the lambdatest dashboard.
- You should the test runs are listed under the `Web Automation` page
  ![test list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6fa7d68-8ac6-4edb-88ba-023ca957ad64)
